This is an wrapper of [ATEM Switchers SDK](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/developer/product/atem) as an openFrameworks addon.
**Still it has really minimum functions in it.** 

## Features
* Switching of video inputs from oF
* Monitoring switching status of hardware

## Prerequisists
* [ATEM Switchers 8.6.1 Update](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/developer/product/atem) is installed


## Current Restrictions
* Only windows supported
* Only tested with Atem Mini

More features should be needed. Your help will be appreciated.
