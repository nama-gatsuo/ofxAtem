# ofxAtem

This is an wrapper of [ATEM Switchers SDK](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/developer/product/atem) as an openFrameworks addon.
**Still it has really minimum functions in it.** 

## Features
* Switching of video inputs from oF
* Monitoring switching status of hardware

## Current Restrictions
* Only windows supported
* Only testes with Atem Mini

More features should be needed. Your help will be appreciated.
